        <h1><li>Bibimbap</li></h1>
        <img src="https://images.yummy.ph/yummy/uploads/2021/02/Bibimbap.jpg" alt="bibibamp">
        <br/>
        <em>Bibimbap is a Korean rice dish that is made by mixing rice, meat, vegetables, and bibimbap sauce.</em>
        <p>
            Bibimbap is a <b>Korean rice dish</b> that comes from bibim, meaning “to mix” and bap,<br/> 
            meaning “rice.” It is usually topped with<br/>
            sauteed or seasoned vegetables, kimchi, raw or fried egg,<br/> 
            and optionally, beef or other meats. To tie it all together, it is served<br/> 
            with bibimbap sauce, which is mainly based on gochugang or red<br/> 
            chili paste, and seasoned with soy sauce, sugar, and spices.
        </p>
        <h1><li>Japchae</li></h1>
        <img src="https://images.yummy.ph/yummy/uploads/2018/05/1805_Yummy_Chapchae_640-01-1.jpg" alt="Japchae">
        <br/>
        <em>This Korean glass noodle dish is sweet, savory, and filled with vegetables!</em>
        <p>
            Japchae comes from jap, meaning “mixed”, and chae, meaning “vegetables”.<br/> 
            Interestingly, it comes from the <b>same Chinese characters that would later<br/>
            be known as chop suey</b> in Chinese cuisine, but the two dishes couldn’t be<br/> 
            more different! Whereas chop suey is a stir-fried vegetable dish, japchae is a<br/>
            Korean glass noodle dish that is seasoned with a light sweet soy sauce with<br/>
            stir-fried vegetables.
        </p>
        <h1><li>Bulgogi</li></h1>
        <img src="https://images.yummy.ph/yummy/uploads/2019/06/01-02-2012_yummy-ph_recipe_beef-bulgogi-rice-topping_image_fboxnew.jpg" alt="bulgogi"> 
        <br/>
        <em>Bulgogi is usually made with beef, but you can also make pork and chicken bulgogi!</em>
        <p>
            Bulgogi is a <b>grilled or roasted Korean meat dish</b>, which can also be <b>stir-fried at home.</b><br/>
            It comes from bul, meaning “fire”, and gogi, meaning “meat”.<br/>
            Traditionally, it is prepared with prime beef cuts like thinly-sliced sirloin, but<br/>
            it can also be made with pork and chicken. It’s a quick Korean food recipe to<br/>
            make as you can prepare ahead of time by mixing your choice of meat with<br/>
            Korean bulgogi marinade, and then simply stir-frying the meat with garlic<br/>
            and other spices.
        </p>
        <h1><li>Tteokbokki</li></h1>
        <img src="https://images.yummy.ph/yummy/uploads/2017/12/tteokbokkirecipe.jpg" alt="tteokbokki">
        <br/>
        <em>Tteokbokki are chewy rice cakes that can be prepared with a variety of sauces.</em>
        <p>
            One of the most popular Korean food is tteokbokki (pronounced: tuk-boh-kee),<br/>
            which is made with tteok or rice cakes, that are simmered or stir-fried<br/>
            in a sauce. Bokki means “something fried”, and depending on the sauce, you<br/> 
            can change the flavor profile of these soft and chewy rice cakes drastically.
            <br/>
            The most famous version these days is made with sweet and spicy<br/> 
            gochujang sauce, with eomuk or fish cake slices, egg, scallions, and garlic<br/>
            added. However, it can be made with a variety of other sauces, or even<br/>
            mixed with ramyun or ramen!
        </p>
        <h1><li>Kimbap</li></h1>
        <img src="https://images.yummy.ph/yummy/uploads/2020/06/kimbap640x360.jpg" alt="Kimbap">
        <p>
          Kimbap are <b>Korean rice rolls</b> that are usually eaten as a <b>snack or a meal on-<br/>
          the-go.</b> They are made by using kim or dried seaweed to wrap the bap or<br/>
          cooked rice and a variety of fillings. The fillings usually include danmuji or<br/>
          yellow pickled radish, egg strips, kimchi, seasoned or stir-fried vegetables,<br/>
          and meat such as ham, kani or imitation crab, or bulgogi. It is a versatile rice<br/> 
          roll that is not only a <b>highly customizable Korean recipe</b> but it is also quite<br/>
          portable and easy to make.
          <br/>
          It may look a lot like the Japanese sushi rolls, but kimbap cannot be more<br/> 
          different. Whereas sushi rice is seasoned with vinegar, kimbap is prepared<br/> 
          by mixing sesame oil with rice. It can also be served as is or with other<br/>
          Korean banchan like kimchi.
        </p>
        <h1><li>Samgyupsal Recipes</li></h1>
        <img src="https://images.yummy.ph/yummy/uploads/2020/06/samgyupsal640x360.jpg" alt="samgyupsal">
        <p>
            Samgyupsal, sometimes spelled sampgyeopsal and sometimes called<br/>
            samgyeopsal-gui, has become <b>a big hit with Filipino Korean food lovers.</b><br/> 
            Samgyupsal means “three-layered flesh”, which refers to the layers you see<br/>
            when you cut into a pork belly. Gui means “to grill”; samgyupsal literally just<br/>
            refers to pork belly (the pork cut), while samgyupsal-gui is the full term<br/>
            when you want to refer to the <b>grilled pork belly dish.</b>
        </p>
        <h1><li>Korean noodles (Ramyun, Jajangmyeon, Jambbong)</li></h1>
        <img src="https://images.yummy.ph/yummy/uploads/2020/06/jajangmyeon.jpg" alt="korean-noodles">
        <br/>
        <em>Jajangmyeon or black bean noodles is just one of the most popular noodle-based Korean comfort food.</em>
        <p>
            Korean noodle dishes are so diverse, but some of the most popular ones are
            ramyun, jajangmyeon, and jambbong or jjamppong.<br/>
            <br/>
            Ramyun is most commonly known as a <b>Korean instant noodle dish</b> that is 
            served with a <b>signature red spicy broth.</b> Unlike the Japanese ramen, 
            is usually prepared fresh, ramyun is a classic <b>Korean comfort food</b> made 
            with instant noodles that can be topped with egg and elevated with meat 
            or other vegetables.<br/>
            <br/>
            Jajangmyeon is a <b>Korean black bean noodle dish</b> that is made with chunjang 
            or black bean paste and meats like diced pork or seafood and vegetables. It 
            is considered as a <b>Chinese-style Korean dish</b>, but since its introduction to 
            Korean culture in the 19th century, it has cemented its place as one of the 
            most beloved Korean noodle dishes. It is popular not only for its unique 
            taste but also because jajjangmyeon ingredients are <b>relatively cheap and 
            easy to prepare.</b><br/>
            <br/>
            Lastly, jambbong or jjamppong is a <b>Korean seafood noodle soup</b> that is 
            known not just for its spiciness but also for the <b>fresh seafood flavors of its 
            broth.</b> It is also considered to be a Chinese-Korean dish, and is usually 
            topped with Korean zucchini, squid, mussels, and pork, with a seafood or 
            pork-based broth that is colored red and made spicy with the addition of 
            gochugaru.
